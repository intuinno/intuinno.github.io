      <description>Recently, I got an email from a smart undergraduate student who was interested in research. I think his situation might be a common case so here I added my reply in the hope that this can be helpful to other students. Below is the modified email message.
 I have been talking with few graduate recruiters and found out that graduate schools donâ€™t offer scholarship unless I am doing PhD or thesis (which I had no idea what that meant).</description>

 Hello Dr.Park,
I am trying to implement carracing. I am using a virtualenv python3.5.4. I am trying to run extract.bash using $sudo bash extract.</description>

      <description>Below is HDILab culture. A culture is a principle about how we do everyday things. I hope that our culture shape our group in a productive way.
We learn by teaching. Every week we will have a paper reading seminar where one student will teach a paper to other lab members. A pizza and a diet coke will be provided. You will have a chance to announce what you are working on nowadays in a friendly environment 30 minutes before the seminar.</description>

      <title>Soft Evolution</title>

      <description>Life evolves. The speed of evolution depends on the mechanism of the evolution. The first evolution was based on the random mutation of the genes. It is basically trial and error. But the diversity of the life forms it generated is awesome. I would call it hard evolution. We, humans, are one of the successful life forms with mosquitoes and cockroaches.
Human adopted a new strategy. It was building a more flexible general purpose brain to adapt to the environment.</description>

      <description>Hello,
My name is Deokgun Park and I lead Human Data Interaction Lab (HDILab) in the Computer Science Engineering Department at the University of Texas at Arlington. In this article, I will explain what problems we are solving at HDILab. In Human Data Interaction Lab, we are studying artificial general intelligence (AGI).
Many students already have an idea about what artificial intelligence (AI) is. But artificial general intelligence or AGI might be a new term.</description>
