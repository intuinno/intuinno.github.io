      <description>Listening to an old professor
who devoted his whole life
looking for the holy grail
couldn&amp;rsquo;t find it
handing over scattered clues
to young, ignorant yet ambitious students
like once he was
in the hope that allowed more time
he could see how minds work
knowing that his time is over.</description>

      <title>Advice for the master students who want to do reserach in my lab</title>

      <description>I get many emails from master students who are interested in reserach.
 I would like to get research experience in my lab. May I join your lab as a master student?
 Below you can find my advice. TLDR, if you plan to pursue PhD after your master, it might be a good idea to experience research in my lab. If you plan to industry career, it might not.</description>

      <title>Advice for the undergraduate students who consider the graduate school</title>

      <description>Recently, I got an email from a smart undergraduate student who was interested in research. I think his situation might be a common case so here I added my reply in the hope that this can be helpful to other students. Below is the modified email message.
 I have been talking with few graduate recruiters and found out that graduate schools donâ€™t offer scholarship unless I am doing PhD or thesis (which I had no idea what that meant).</description>

      <description>Recently, I got an email from a student from HDILab. I think his situation might be a common case so here I added my reply in the hope that this can be helpful to other students. Below is the modified email message from the student.
 Hello Dr.Park,
I am trying to implement carracing. I am using a virtualenv python3.5.4. I am trying to run extract.bash using $sudo bash extract.</description>

      <description>Below is HDILab culture. A culture is a principle about how we do everyday things. I hope that our culture shape our group in a productive way.
We learn by teaching. Every week we will have a paper reading seminar where one student will teach a paper to other lab members. A pizza and a diet coke will be provided. You will have a chance to announce what you are working on nowadays in a friendly environment 30 minutes before the seminar.</description>

      <title>Soft Evolution</title>

      <description>Life evolves. The speed of evolution depends on the mechanism of the evolution. The first evolution was based on the random mutation of genes. It is basically trial and error. But the diversity of the life forms it generated is awesome. I would call it hard evolution. We, humans, are one of the successful life forms with mosquitoes and cockroaches.
Human adopted a new strategy. It was building a more flexible general purpose brain to adapt to the environment.</description>

      <description>Hello,
My name is Deokgun Park and I lead Human Data Interaction Lab (HDILab) in the Department of Computer Science &amp;amp; Engineering at the University of Texas at Arlington. In this article, I will explain the problems we are solving at HDILab. In Human Data Interaction Lab, we are studying artificial general intelligence (AGI).
Many students already have an idea about artificial intelligence (AI). But artificial general intelligence or AGI might be a new term.</description>
