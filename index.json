For certain datasets and tasks, unit visualizations can provide more information, better match the user's mental model, and enable novel interactions compared to traditional aggregated visualizations. Current visualization grammars cannot fully describe the unit visualization family. In this paper, we characterize the design space of unit visualizations to derive a grammar that can express them. The resulting grammar is called ATOM, and is based on passing data through a series of layout operations that divide the output of previous operations recursively until the size and position of every data point can be determined. We evaluate the expressive power of the grammar by both using it to describe existing unit visualizations, as well as to suggest new unit visualizations.","tags":["Information Visualization"],"title":"Atom: A Grammar for Unit Visualizations","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536469200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536469200,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"https://intuinno.github.io/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":["Deokgun Park","Seungyeon Kim","Jurim Lee","Jaegul Choo","Nicholas Diakopoulos","Niklas Elmqvist"],"categories":null,"content":"  The CommentIQ UI showing toggleable visualizations such as scatterplot, map, and timeline (left) that enable overview and filtering of comments, as well as an adjustable ranking based on various weighted quality criteria (right).ConceptVector supports interactive construction of lexicon-based concepts.

Advances in word embedding allow building a concept from a small set of seed terms. However, naive application of such techniques may result in false positive errors because of the polysemy of natural language. To mitigate this problem, we present a visual analytics system called ConceptVector that guides a user in building such concepts and then using them to analyze documents. Document-analysis case studies with real-world datasets demonstrate the fine-grained analysis provided by ConceptVector. To support the elaborate modeling of concepts, we introduce a bipolar concept model and support for specifying irrelevant words. We validate the interactive lexicon building interface by a user study and expert reviews. Quantitative evaluation shows that the bipolar lexicon generated with our methods is comparable to human-generated ones.","tags":["Text Analysis","Visual Analytics","Open-ended Tasks"],"title":"ConceptVector: Text Visual Analytics via Interactive Lexicon Building Using Word Embedding","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.\n Slides can be added in a few ways:\n Create slides using Academic\u0026rsquo;s Slides feature and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Upload an existing slide deck to static/ and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Embed your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using shortcodes.

The varying quality of these comments necessitates that publishers remove the low quality ones, but there is also a growing awareness that by identifying and highlighting high quality contributions this can promote the general quality of the community. In this paper we take a user-centered design approach towards developing a system, CommentIQ, which supports comment moderators in interactively identifying high quality comments using a combination of comment analytic scores as well as visualizations and flexible UI components. We evaluated this system with professional comment moderators working at local and national news outlets and provide insights into the utility and appropriateness of features for journalistic tasks, as well as how the system may enable or transform journalistic practices around online comments.","tags":["Text Analysis","Visual Analytics","Open-ended Tasks"],"title":"Supporting comment moderators in identifying high quality online news comments","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Two groups in the movie space have been selected to compare corresponding user distribution. Two movies selected in the upper-center region—One flew Over the Cuckoos Nest (1975) and Amadeus (1984)–and are shown in blue color. Another two movies selected in a lower-center region—Phenomenon (1996) and Twister (1996)—are shown in orange. The highlighted users are those who liked all both pairs of movies (because the group mode is set to common). Based on the user space axes—gender for the horizontal and age for the vertical—we can see that while the movie One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest and Amadeus were favored by male reviewers of all ages, the Phenomenon and Twister were liked by relatively younger male audiences.    On the left, we compare two movies, Toy Story (1995), in blue, and Scream (1996), in orange, according to the age, location and similarity criteria for users. Some notable observations are while the former is liked all around the U.S. by any age groups the latter is mostly popular in the eastern part and within a younger generation. On the right, we compare two users, a 19-year-old male student, in blue, and a 51-year-old male educator, in orange according to the average, release date, and similarity criteria for movies. We observe that the older user tends to rate older films highly. In addition, his average review tends to conform to the average ratings patterns of all users while the younger user seems to deviate from it.

This dyadic data is displayed as weighted bipartite graphs using scatterplots in two separated visual spaces, where each entity is positioned according to multi-dimensional properties of each entity or similarity in preferences. Selecting or navigating in one space is reflected in the other space, so that organic visual patterns can be formed to facilitate the characterization of underlying groupings. To aid visual pattern recognition we also overlay a contour plot based on kernel density estimation. We have implemented two instantiations of ParallelSpaces for (a) movie preferences, and (b) business reviews as Web-based visualizations. To validate the method, we performed a qualitative user study involving eleven participants using these Web-based tools to explore data and collect deep insights.
