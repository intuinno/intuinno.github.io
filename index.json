[{"authors":["Deokgun Park"],"categories":null,"content":" Life evolves. The speed of evolution depends on the mechanism of the evolution. The first evolution was based on the random mutation of the genes. It is basically trial and error. But the diversity of the life forms it generated is awesome. I would call it hard evolution. We, humans, are one of the successful life forms with mosquitoes and cockroaches.\nHuman adopted a new strategy. It was building a more flexible general purpose brain to adapt to the environment. Other life forms also have the brain. But its function was more rigid or hard encoded. You can think how the pocket calculator compares with the smartphone. Both have a similar electronic components namely CPU, memory and I/O devices.\nUsing the general brain, we can do many things that was not possible. But the essential function is learning. In hard evolution, the special variation that worked well leaves the genes. However, in soft evolution, we can learn from others. It basically allows the exponential trial and errors. Nobody can experience all the diverse experience in the world given limited time and energy. Still we can learn from others first using verbal language. This allowed us to transfer knowledge from the nearby persons. The written language allowed it to go beyond the limitation of the space and time of the verbal language. Now what is beautiful about the soft evolution is that the time it takes to evolve has reduced dramatically. The soft evolution happens in the brain circuitry during the life time of the agent while in the hard evolution, the life time of the agent was a single unit of progress.\nBecause of this general flexible brain, we are born as rather blank state compared to other animals such as cats and dogs. Of course there are still many innate circuitry which I will talk later. And it takes relatively long time to have a reasonably working program. Interestingly as the amount of the information to function well in the society increases the time it takes to be independent is also increasing. Now it is common in the first world that it takes about 20 to 30 years before one can be independent from the parents.\nI said the brain is born as a basically blank state. But still there are innate mechanism to help learn from the parents. Think of the truly blank state agent. We got a continuous stream of image and sound. How we can make sense of the this image? For example, parents talking to the baby might look like a skin colored chunk with a few holes that are constantly moving. One hole continuously changes shape and make a sound (hint: mouth). How can we learn this chunk of image is a mom and the sound is the language which is different from random noise from the street? Epistemology is an old branch of philosophy devoted to this problem.\nI think the innate mechanism is essential for the new born baby to make sense of the world. Let me give you an example. Andrew Meltzoff and Keith Moore found that a baby who was about 7 hours since the birth can still mimic the tongue movements. It is quite surprising when we think about all the skills to do this. First, the baby has to recognize the human face. Then he has to map the human face he never seen to his face that he never seen himself. Finally the baby has to control the tongue to imitate the expression.\n New born baby can imitate the random facial expression. This capabilities an innate mechanism to help learn from others. We should learn from relevant objects such as people and care givers and not from irrelevant objects such as cars or doors. Image from Science 1977   I believe this imitation capability is essential to learn from others. Given blank state, we should not fill this blank with random noise but relevant contents. What will be the relevant contents for the new born baby. Most likely it will be from the parents and caregivers. The imitation mechanism has already filtered irrelevant objects in the world and focused on the human facial expression and followed its motion. This limits the vast space of the exploration to meaningful trajectory that was suggested by human.\nLessons for the AGI In the famous DQN paper, there are experiments for the Atari games. Among many games that showed superhuman performance by the artificial agent, there was one game that showed very poor performance called Montezuma\u0026rsquo;s revenge.\n  This blog explains why the Montezuma\u0026rsquo;s revenge game is particularly challenging. In a summary, there are too many things that have to be done sequentially such as getting the key, avoid the monster, and go back to the door. The random behavior by the agent cannot explore the vast exploration space in a limited time. In 100 Million iterations, the agent can access only the second stage. This shows the limitation of the random trial and error. I said other animals cannot learn. But I was wrong. They can learn. For example, dogs can learn new trick. They learn by trial and error. They associate behaviors with positive rewards or treats. But things you can learn from this approach is limited.\nI think there are three components for the artificial general intelligence. The first is a model. For example, in my HPM theory, the agent predicts the next sensory input with the help from the hierarchy to do the higher-order prediction (chunking). The second is an environment. It provides a source of information. The problem is there are vast space for exploration. Finally there will be many smart tricks such as imitation or social mechanism to focus on the human interaction during language acquisition to reduce this search space effectively by social learning. Our lab tries to build an environment that can provide a testbed for such social mechanism and study the models.\nFinally, what will be the next step for the evolution? I think it will be how we can limit the limitation of the brain cell. The brain cell is relatively small and degradable. If we can use our electronic components as a device, it will achieve a step-up in the evolution speed. But more importantly, I think the true power of the next evolution is when the artificial intelligence agent upgrades its own structure. This upgrades will be beyond the human\u0026rsquo;s ability to follow which is called technical singularity. Some would call it computational evolution.\n The evolution of the intelligence   ","date":1564981200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565024762,"objectID":"9e80d9eba7c40220c7be82fbc83fd54e","permalink":"http://crystal.uta.edu/~park/post/soft-evolution/","publishdate":"2019-08-05T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/soft-evolution/","section":"post","summary":"The first evolution mechanism was based on the DNA.

For certain datasets and tasks, unit visualizations can provide more information, better match the user's mental model, and enable novel interactions compared to traditional aggregated visualizations. Current visualization grammars cannot fully describe the unit visualization family. In this paper, we characterize the design space of unit visualizations to derive a grammar that can express them. The resulting grammar is called ATOM, and is based on passing data through a series of layout operations that divide the output of previous operations recursively until the size and position of every data point can be determined. We evaluate the expressive power of the grammar by both using it to describe existing unit visualizations, as well as to suggest new unit visualizations.","tags":["Information Visualization"],"title":"Atom: A Grammar for Unit Visualizations","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536469200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538188338,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"http://crystal.uta.edu/~park/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":["Deokgun Park","Seungyeon Kim","Jurim Lee","Jaegul Choo","Nicholas Diakopoulos","Niklas Elmqvist"],"categories":null,"content":"  The CommentIQ UI showing toggleable visualizations such as scatterplot, map, and timeline (left) that enable overview and filtering of comments, as well as an adjustable ranking based on various weighted quality criteria (right).ConceptVector supports interactive construction of lexicon-based concepts.

Advances in word embedding allow building a concept from a small set of seed terms. However, naive application of such techniques may result in false positive errors because of the polysemy of natural language. To mitigate this problem, we present a visual analytics system called ConceptVector that guides a user in building such concepts and then using them to analyze documents. Document-analysis case studies with real-world datasets demonstrate the fine-grained analysis provided by ConceptVector. To support the elaborate modeling of concepts, we introduce a bipolar concept model and support for specifying irrelevant words. We validate the interactive lexicon building interface by a user study and expert reviews. Quantitative evaluation shows that the bipolar lexicon generated with our methods is comparable to human-generated ones.","tags":["Text Analysis","Visual Analytics","Open-ended Tasks"],"title":"ConceptVector: Text Visual Analytics via Interactive Lexicon Building Using Word Embedding","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Deokgun Park"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483250400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548263775,"objectID":"b114db2e37f3222e6421fb54941f18d1","permalink":"http://crystal.uta.edu/~park/talk/naver/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/talk/naver/","section":"talk","summary":"A comment section, such as for an online news article, video, or social media post, is commonly a place to share personal opinions. However, when there are too many comments, it is challenging to gain new insights and estimate the distribution of the public opinions simply by reading them. Selecting and promoting high-quality comments can mitigate those problems, but the required resources for choosing them manually are too high for common practice. In this talk, I will introduce my research on visual analytics for comment analysis. The ability to see an overview of the comments and to create custom rankings supports moderators, editors, and commenters themselves. I also propose a method to aid semantic analysis where users can build custom dictionaries for unique concepts and use them to analyze comments. In the future, assessing public opinions will play an important role in protecting the digital democracy against organized attempts to manipulate public opinions.","tags":[],"title":"Visual Analytics for Comment Analysis (in Korean)","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Deokgun Park","Simranjit Sachar","Nicholas Diakopoulos","Niklas Elmqvist"],"categories":null,"content":"  The CommentIQ UI showing toggleable visualizations such as scatterplot, map, and timeline (left) that enable overview and filtering of comments, as well as an adjustable ranking based on various weighted quality criteria (right).

In this article, I will explain what problems we are solving at HDILab. In Human Data Interaction Lab, we are studying artificial general intelligence (AGI).\nMany students already have an idea about what artificial intelligence (AI) is. But artificial general intelligence or AGI might be a new term. So let\u0026rsquo;s start with what AGI is.\nClarifying AI and AGI Since Marvin Minsky and other researchers gathered at Dartmouth College in Hanover in 1956, the goal of AI was building a machine that can do many tasks like humans. But after experiencing a few AI winters, the academic focus shifted to building models to perform a single application because it was more tractable. This approach has been frequently called machine learning (ML). It is said that one of the reason ML has been coined was to avoid mentioning AI in the proposal during the AI winters. It was successful, and we achieved many advances in specific applications such as image classification, machine translation, self-driving car, or playing Go game. And the term AI became hot again.\nBut we still lack an idea about how we can build a general-purpose AI which appears in Hollywood movies or general public associates with. Because most of the current AI research is application-specific, we need another term for the original general purpose agent. It has been rephrased many times, including\n strong AI true AI human-like AI movie-like AI lifelong learning continual learning meta learning or learning to learn artificial general intelligence (AGI)  We will use AGI to refer this original AI because it tells the fundamental difference between the current mainstream AI research, which is application-specific.\n AI vs AGI. AI started as a general purpose model, but later changed its meaning to mostly application specific models. We will use artificial general intelligence (AGI) to mean the original general purpose model.   How to test AGI Before we discuss how we can build AGI, let\u0026rsquo;s start with how we can test whether if we built AGI. Because according to Peter Drucker or Lord Kelvin,\n If you can\u0026rsquo;t measure it, you can\u0026rsquo;t improve it.\n Alan Turing suggested a test to verify AGI. According to the Turing test also known as Imitation Game, a human participant asks an agent hidden behind the wall to perform many tasks. If the human cannot discern whether the agent is truly a human or an artificial agent, then the artificial agent is assumed to achieve a human-level intelligence.\n In the movie Ex Machina, you can see how Turing test is conducted.   While theoretically valid, it poses several problems in its practical application. First, it is too difficult for the current status of research. The human tester can use all the knowledge about the world to test the agent, yet it would be very costly and impossible to teach all the knowledge about the world to the artificial agent, while researchers struggle to discover how we can mimic human-like learning. It is like asking a kinder to take SAT test.\nSecond, the test does not provide any idea about where the model can learn those knowledges required to take test. It is like testing students without giving them any textbooks or lectures.\nThird, even for the same model and the same evaluator, the feedback will be different from today to tomorrow. The test is subjective and not reproducible.\nFinally, it is prohibitively expensive to hire people to conduct a test. Humans may participate in annual Turing test competition, but during the hyperparameter tuning or iterative model refinement it is difficult to get access to human testers. For these reasons, it is not practically applicable in the current renaissance of the AI.\nWe propose an alternative test method for AGI. This method is based on the observation that even if we raise cats and dogs, treating them like human babies, they cannot learn to speak. The animals are capability-limited, and the human baby cannot learn to speak if it is separated from people speaking to it. It is environment-limited. Therefore we can think that the language acquisition is the function of the environment and the capability of the learning agent. In other words, if an agent can learn how to speak in a proper environment, we can say that it has the capability to do artificial general intelligence. We call it the Language Acquisition Test for AGI or Park\u0026rsquo;s test.\n In Park\u0026rsquo;s test, the agent is said to have a human-level intelligence if it can learn language given the proper environment   To pass a Park\u0026rsquo;s test, we needs a capable model and a proper environment. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at environment first.\nThe Environment for the Language Acquisition To conduct the Park\u0026rsquo;s AGI Test, an agent requires an interaction with the world to learn how to speak. One factor that enabled the recent advances in reinforcement learning was the use of the simulated environments such as Atari games or 3D first person shooting games such as VizDoom. Those environments can be used to build and test an agent that can optimize its behavior with little instructions while maximizing the reward signal as a goal to train an agent. However, environments and reward signals adopted in those studies are primitive and more suitable for the development of low-level intelligence which can be found in fish or bugs.\n               Atari Environment Car Racing Environment RoboSchool Environment    If we want to build an agent with human-level of intelligence, we need to use an environment that can provide a reasonable sensory input and feedback that can teach an agent how to speak. One naive way to provide such an environment is using real people to provide the required responses or trainings. However, using real people has similar limitations with the Turing test. We will have to explore many models in a trial and error before we can finally build an AGI. In addition to the prohibitive cost of using human participants, human experimenters will become quickly tired of providing the same feedback again and again or providing different feedback to the same situation which does not lead to reproducible research.\n   Advanced Discussion: What is language?     Some would claim that the poor baby abandoned in jungle will still develop a language to communicate with other animal. Similarly there is an emergent communication pattern among collaborative robots. While true, we are interested in human language in this project especially for human robot interaction. The rationale is that we want the robot to learn human language not vice versa.    There are a few prior researches in language acquisition. Devendra Singh Chaplot and other researchers in the Carnegie Melon University used VizDoom environment to demonstrate how agent can learn semantic concepts using reinforcement learning. In their experiments, agents get rewards when they go to objects according to the verbal direction such as \u0026ldquo;Go to short blue torch\u0026rdquo;. What is interesting is that during the training the agents experience verbal direction such as \u0026ldquo;Go to blue torch\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Go to torch\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Got to short red torch\u0026rdquo; and so on but never experience \u0026ldquo;short blue torch\u0026rdquo;. Even then during the test time, they can follow the direction to go to \u0026ldquo;short blue torch\u0026rdquo;. This implies that the agent can map the words such as \u0026ldquo;short\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;blue\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;torch\u0026rdquo; with the visual features in the objects. This is a step forward to solve the symbol grounding problem.\n Agents learns language using reinforcement learning. Image by Devendra Singh Chaplot et al   But the concepts that can be learned in this way is limited. There are limitations due to the environments. We don\u0026rsquo;t learn by fetching objects according to the parent directions. It will take too long all the concepts this way. We need a better environments that can teach the language\nWhen the transistor was first invented, people were excited to use it as an amplifier to build radio and radars. But the true power of the transistor was when it was arranged in a specific structure, it could build a logic gate. By arranging logic gates in a specific way, we could build a CPU, the true ultimate power of transistor.\nThe same goes with the connectionism. We know how one or two neural cell behaves exactly and we can simulate them. But most advancement came with the arrangement of this device in a specific ways, such as multi-layer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural net (CNN), recurrent neural net (RNN), and generative adversarial network (GAN). In this sense, we are experimental computer scientist who seek the right structure mostly by trial and errors. Because of this nature, it is helpful to have an environment that can provide an easy, low-cost, and reproducible way to experiment.\nIn our lab, we would like to develop an environment for Park\u0026rsquo;s test. The key idea is that we will focus on the critical stage of the human development when humans learn how to speak as infants. This environment will contain a 3D replication of a room in the home with a few toys. There will be a mother character and a baby character. The mother character is programmed manually using traditional game AI technology to take care of the baby and lead a conversation with the baby character which is often called a baby talk, child-directed speech (CDS), motherese or infant directed speech (IDS). IDS is a communication pattern, when a mother tries to teach language to an infant. The baby character will be the learning agent. The success of the test will be decided by whether the learning agents can acquire language and develop reasonable behavior comparable to the human developmental progress.\n Previous environments have led the advancements of the reinforcement learning. We propose a novel environment for the language learning.

Two groups in the movie space have been selected to compare corresponding user distribution. Two movies selected in the upper-center region—One flew Over the Cuckoos Nest (1975) and Amadeus (1984)–and are shown in blue color. Another two movies selected in a lower-center region—Phenomenon (1996) and Twister (1996)—are shown in orange. The highlighted users are those who liked all both pairs of movies (because the group mode is set to common). Based on the user space axes—gender for the horizontal and age for the vertical—we can see that while the movie One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest and Amadeus were favored by male reviewers of all ages, the Phenomenon and Twister were liked by relatively younger male audiences.    On the left, we compare two movies, Toy Story (1995), in blue, and Scream (1996), in orange, according to the age, location and similarity criteria for users. Some notable observations are while the former is liked all around the U.S. by any age groups the latter is mostly popular in the eastern part and within a younger generation. On the right, we compare two users, a 19-year-old male student, in blue, and a 51-year-old male educator, in orange according to the average, release date, and similarity criteria for movies. We observe that the older user tends to rate older films highly. In addition, his average review tends to conform to the average ratings patterns of all users while the younger user seems to deviate from it.

This dyadic data is displayed as weighted bipartite graphs using scatterplots in two separated visual spaces, where each entity is positioned according to multi-dimensional properties of each entity or similarity in preferences. Selecting or navigating in one space is reflected in the other space, so that organic visual patterns can be formed to facilitate the characterization of underlying groupings. To aid visual pattern recognition we also overlay a contour plot based on kernel density estimation. We have implemented two instantiations of ParallelSpaces for (a) movie preferences, and (b) business reviews as Web-based visualizations. To validate the method, we performed a qualitative user study involving eleven participants using these Web-based tools to explore data and collect deep insights.
