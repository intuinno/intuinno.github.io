      <description>The MovieVis tool. Two groups in the movie space have been selected to compare corresponding user distribution. Two movies selected in the upper-center region—One flew Over the Cuckoos Nest (1975) and Amadeus (1984)–and are shown in blue color. Another two movies selected in a lower-center region—Phenomenon (1996) and Twister (1996)—are shown in orange. The highlighted users are those who liked all both pairs of movies (because the group mode is set to common).</description>
