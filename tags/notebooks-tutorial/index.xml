      <title>08 - Importing</title>
      <link>http://crystal.uta.edu/~park/notes/08-importing/</link>

      <guid>http://crystal.uta.edu/~park/notes/08-importing/</guid>
      <description>08 - Importing You can import the following formats via Notable -&amp;gt; Import:
 Markdown files with extension: md, mkd, mdwn, mdown, markdown, markdn, mdtxt, mdtext or txt. Evernotes&amp;rsquo; exports with extension: enex.  Alternatively you could also just put your Markdown notes into the notes sub-directory into your data directory.
The more notes you are importing the longer it will take, in some cases the interface may freeze until the operation is completed.</description>

      <title>09 - Multi-Note Editing</title>
      <link>http://crystal.uta.edu/~park/notes/09-multi-note-editing/</link>

      <guid>http://crystal.uta.edu/~park/notes/09-multi-note-editing/</guid>
      <description>09 - Multi-Note Editing Built-in Some multi-note editing features are built-in.
There are multiple ways to select notes:
 Click: you can toggle a note&amp;rsquo;s selection just by clicking it in the middlebar with Cmd+Click on macOS, or with Ctrl+Click elsewhere.
 Shortcuts: some shortcuts are provided under the Edit menu entry for selecting all notes, inverting the selection and unselecting all of them.
  When 2 or more notes are selected a multi-note editor will be displayed in the mainbar, you&amp;rsquo;ll be asked for confirmation for all changes that will mutate the notes.</description>

      <title>10 - Linking Attachments, Notes, Tags and Searches</title>
      <link>http://crystal.uta.edu/~park/notes/10-linking-attachments-notes-tags-and-searches/</link>

      <guid>http://crystal.uta.edu/~park/notes/10-linking-attachments-notes-tags-and-searches/</guid>
      <description>10 - Linking Attachments, Notes, Tags and Searches Sometimes, like when writing a tutorial for a note-taking app ðŸ˜‰, you may need to link to other notes or embed a few attachments. Notable makes this easy for you.
These special links can also be right-clicked so that you can perform some actions on them.
Attachments Attachments can be rendered inline, linked to, and linked to via a button. The @attachment token is used for this.</description>

      <title>11 - Synchronization</title>
      <link>http://crystal.uta.edu/~park/notes/11-synchronization/</link>

      <guid>http://crystal.uta.edu/~park/notes/11-synchronization/</guid>
      <description>11 - Synchronization Notable doesn&amp;rsquo;t have synchronization built-in, but you can have your data synchronized across computers just by putting the data directory into a shared folder, like Dropbox/Google Drive/etc.
This way the third-party service will take care of the synchronization.</description>

      <title>12 - Mobile Editing</title>
      <link>http://crystal.uta.edu/~park/notes/12-mobile-editing/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2019 12:20:11 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://crystal.uta.edu/~park/notes/12-mobile-editing/</guid>
      <description>12 - Mobile Editing Notable doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a mobile app yet, but there are many apps for editing Markdown files already on mobile.
If you put your data directory into a shared folder, like Dropbox/Google Drive/etc. you could use any of those apps for editing notes or making new ones.
It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be perfect, especially if you need to change some metadata or add an attachment, but it would be ok most of the times.</description>

      <title>13 - Collaborative Editing</title>
      <link>http://crystal.uta.edu/~park/notes/13-collaborative-editing/</link>

      <guid>http://crystal.uta.edu/~park/notes/13-collaborative-editing/</guid>
      <description>13 - Collaborative Editing Notable doesn&amp;rsquo;t have collaborative editing built-in, but if you put your data directory in a shared folder, like Dropbox/Google Drive/etc. then multiple people can access it and make edits at the same time.
Just make sure no 2 people are working on the same note at the same time, or some work might get lost.
This is by no means a perfect solution though.</description>

      <title>14 - Version Control</title>
      <link>http://crystal.uta.edu/~park/notes/14-version-control/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2019 12:20:11 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://crystal.uta.edu/~park/notes/14-version-control/</guid>
      <description>14 - Version Control Notable doesn&amp;rsquo;t have version control built-in, but since the data directory is just a regular directory you could make it a git repository and every once in a while take a snapshot of your notes, or perhaps a small script could make commits automatically for you everytime something changes.
If there&amp;rsquo;s a big demand for this perhaps support for version controlled notes can be added to Notable itself, let us know if you need this.</description>

      <guid>http://crystal.uta.edu/~park/notes/15-encrypted-notes/</guid>
      <description>15 - Encrypted Notes Notable doesn&amp;rsquo;t support encrypted notes yet, but if you really need this you could make an encrypted image on your computer and put a data directory in there.
This way the third-party program will take care of the encryption.
If there&amp;rsquo;s a big demand for this perhaps support for encrypted notes can be added to Notable itself, let us know if you need this.</description>

      <title>Wrapping up ðŸŽ‰</title>
      <link>http://crystal.uta.edu/~park/notes/wrapping-up-/</link>

      <guid>http://crystal.uta.edu/~park/notes/wrapping-up-/</guid>
      <description>Wrapping up ðŸŽ‰ Awesome, you&amp;rsquo;ve reached the end of the tutorial!
The next step is deleting all these tutorial notes, you can do this one-by-one, using multi-note editing, or you could just trash the whole notes sub-directory from your data directory.
Feedback If you&amp;rsquo;ve reached this far chances are you&amp;rsquo;re considering using Notable as your main note-taking app, that&amp;rsquo;s great!
Feel free to contact us about any issues you may encounter, any features suggestions and generally sharing your opinion about Notable and how we can improve it.</description>

      <guid>http://crystal.uta.edu/~park/notes/01-the-data-directory/</guid>
      <description>01 - The Data Directory The data directory is where all your notes and attachments will be stored, it has the following structure:
/path/to/your/data_directory â”œâ”€â”¬ attachments â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ foo.ext â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ bar.ext â”‚ â””â”€â”€ â€¦ â””â”€â”¬ notes â”œâ”€â”€ foo.md â”œâ”€â”€ bar.md â””â”€â”€ â€¦  Features  The data directory gives you freedom since your notes are never locked into some sort of proprietary database, all your files use sane formats and are easily accessible and portable.</description>

      <guid>http://crystal.uta.edu/~park/notes/02-the-sidebar/</guid>
      <description>02 - The Sidebar The sidebar is where all your notes are categorized.

Notebooks: This section contains all notes tagged with the special Notebooks/* tag. Tags: This section contains all notes tagged with any tag except the special ones: Notebooks/* and Templates/*. Templates: This section contains all notes tagged with the special Templates/* tag.</description>

      <title>03 - The Middlebar</title>

      <pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2019 12:20:10 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://crystal.uta.edu/~park/notes/03-the-middlebar/</guid>
      <description>03 - The Middlebar The middlebar shows you all notes contained in the currently active category, properly ordered and filtered by the search query.
Search To search just type something in the search bar.
The title of notes is searched in fuzzily, which basically means that you can omit some characters from the query: if for instance there&amp;rsquo;s a note titled &amp;ldquo;Notable&amp;rdquo; you can also find it by typing &amp;ldquo;Noab&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Notae&amp;rdquo;, as long as the characters are in the right order the note will be found.</description>

      <guid>http://crystal.uta.edu/~park/notes/04-the-mainbar/</guid>
      <description>04 - The Mainbar The mainbar is where you can preview and edit the currently active note.
Toolbar The toolbar contains buttons for triggering actions to the current note, all of them are also accessible via shortcuts.
Preview/Editor/Multi-Editor Right below the toolbar there&amp;rsquo;s the preview/editor/multi-editor area.
Preview Rendered notes are displayed here.
Editor When editing you&amp;rsquo;ll use Monaco Editor, the same editor VS Code uses, which comes with features like multi-cursor built-in.</description>

      <title>05 - Notes</title>
      <link>http://crystal.uta.edu/~park/notes/05-notes/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2019 12:20:10 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://crystal.uta.edu/~park/notes/05-notes/</guid>
      <description>05 - Notes Syntax Notes are written in GitHub-flavored Markdown, so you can write emojis (ðŸ˜‚ -&amp;gt; ðŸ˜‚), strikethrough text etc. in a familiar fashion.
This also means that your notes aren&amp;rsquo;t locked into any proprietary format.
Notes can have some metadata: if they are favorited or not, which tags they have, which attachments they have, etc. These metadata are written as Markdown front matter. This is taken care of for you.</description>

      <guid>http://crystal.uta.edu/~park/notes/06-tags/</guid>
      <description>06 - Tags Notes can have multiple tags, which are useful for better categorization.
Syntax  Root: Root tags don&amp;rsquo;t contain any forward slash (/). If there are any notebooks or templates defined they will be rendered inside the special Tags section in the sidebar, otherwise the Tags parent section will be omitted.
 Nested: Tags can also be nested, indefinitely, just write them like a path, separating the levels with a forward slash: foo/bar/baz.</description>
