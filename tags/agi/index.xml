      <description>Life evolves. The speed of evolution depends on the mechanism of the evolution. The first evolution was based on the random mutation of the genes. It is basically trial and error. But the diversity of the life forms it generated is awesome. I would call it hard evolution. We, humans, are one of the successful life forms with mosquitoes and cockroaches.
Human adopted a new strategy. It was building a more flexible general purpose brain to adapt to the environment.</description>

      <description>Hello,
My name is Deokgun Park and I lead Human Data Interaction Lab (HDILab) in the Computer Science Engineering Department at the University of Texas at Arlington. In this article, I will explain what problems we are solving at HDILab. In Human Data Interaction Lab, we are studying artificial general intelligence (AGI).
Many students already have an idea about what artificial intelligence (AI) is. But artificial general intelligence or AGI might be a new term.</description>
