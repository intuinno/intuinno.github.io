      <description>Below is adopted from forward in my Ph.D disseration.
 A man&amp;rsquo;s character is his fate. - Heraclitus
 It all began with the naıve and lazy man’s dream. I wanted interesting information to come to me even though I didn’t know if such information existed, and I didn’t search for it. I am lazy but addicted to information. I am also a Maximizer. According to the book The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less by Barry Schwartz, a Maximizer is the kind of person who scans all the available cereals in the supermarket and tries to select the best one.</description>

      <description>The CommentIQ UI showing toggleable visualizations such as scatterplot, map, and timeline (left) that enable overview and filtering of comments, as well as an adjustable ranking based on various weighted quality criteria (right).ConceptVector supports interactive construction of lexicon-based concepts. Here the user creates a new unipolar concept (1) by adding initial keywords related to tidal flooding (2). The system recommends related words along with their semantic groupings (3), also shown in a scatterplot (4), revealing word- and cluster-level relationships.</description>

      <description>The MovieVis tool. Two groups in the movie space have been selected to compare corresponding user distribution. Two movies selected in the upper-center region—One flew Over the Cuckoos Nest (1975) and Amadeus (1984)–and are shown in blue color. Another two movies selected in a lower-center region—Phenomenon (1996) and Twister (1996)—are shown in orange. The highlighted users are those who liked all both pairs of movies (because the group mode is set to common).</description>
